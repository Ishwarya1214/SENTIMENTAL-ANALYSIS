## 🌟 **Project Description**
This project, titled **"Sentiment-Scope"**, focuses on the development of a robust sentiment analysis model for classifying tweets into **positive** or **negative** categories. Social media platforms like **Twitter** are essential spaces for public discourse, where opinions on diverse topics are shared in real-time.  

The project's primary objective is to leverage **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques and **Machine Learning** algorithms to extract actionable insights from unstructured data, helping businesses, researchers, and governments understand public sentiment.

## ⚙️ **Framework and Tools Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python (v3.13.0)
- **Framework**: Streamlit for interactive dashboards and web-based visualizations
- **Libraries**: 
  - NLP: NLTK, Scikit-Learn
  - Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy
  - Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
- **Algorithm**: Naive Bayes (for text classification)

---

## 🔑 **Key Features**
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Noise removal, stop-word removal, tokenization, and stemming.
   - Standardized text for reliable analysis.
2. **Text Representation**: 
   - Utilized Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (**TF-IDF**) for numerical feature extraction.
3. **Model Training and Evaluation**: 
   - Trained using Naive Bayes classifier.
   - Achieved **78% accuracy** on test data.
4. **Interactive UI**:
   - Built using **Streamlit** to allow users to input their own tweets and visualize results.
