# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

&#x20;

## Overview

Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a project designed to analyze tweets and determine the sentiment behind them. It categorizes sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral, offering valuable insights into public opinion, trends, and behaviors.

This application is built using Python and Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for sentiment analysis.

## Features

- Fetch tweets using Twitter API.
- Perform sentiment analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
- Visualize sentiment distribution with intuitive charts and graphs.
- Interactive Streamlit interface for ease of use.

## Frameworks and Libraries Used

### Backend:

- **Python**: Core programming language used for analysis and processing.
- **Tweepy**: For accessing Twitter API and fetching tweets.
- **TextBlob/VADER**: For performing sentiment analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

### Frontend:

- **Streamlit**: For creating a seamless, interactive web application.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For visualizing sentiment analysis results.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Twitter Developer Account with API credentials

### Steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd twitter-sentiment-analysis
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up Twitter API credentials in a `.env` file:
   ```env
   TWITTER_API_KEY=your_api_key
   TWITTER_API_SECRET_KEY=your_api_secret_key
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=your_access_token_secret
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How to Use

1. Launch the application locally by running the Streamlit app.
2. Enter a hashtag or keyword to fetch tweets related to your query.
3. View the analyzed sentiment breakdown in the form of:
   - Bar charts
   - Pie charts
   - Word clouds
